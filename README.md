The programming langugae used is Java and iDE is InteliJ.  

The project is about reprensting logic sentences. 

Part 1: Basic Model Checking 

Uses Entailment Method 


Part 2: 

Uses DPLL method


These problems that have been implemented: 

1. Modus Ponenes 
2. Wumpus World(Simple)
  
Additional: 
3. Horn Clauses 
4. Liars and Truth-tellers (part a & b)(adapted from OSSMB). 
5. More Liars and Truth-tellers (adapted from JRM12 392)

Go to the respective KB class to check the sample problems. Each main method uses entailment and DPLL to check the truth values of the propositional logic sentences. 
You don't have to comment out Entailment to check with DPLL. 

**However,only for Part 4 (Truth LieKB) comment out part (a) when testing for part (b) and vice -versa.
